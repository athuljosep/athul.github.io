# Welcome to Athul Jose Pulikkottil's Personal Website

## About Me
Hello! I'm Athul Pulikkottil, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at WSU's Pullman campus. I hold a B. Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from India and a master's in Power Systems. My work with Kerala State Electricity Board and the Department of Science and Technology has nurtured my passion for the power sector, making it my specialization.

I'm intrigued by the math of interconnected grids and aim to address engineering challenges. WSU's innovative projects, backed by collaborations with national labs, led me here. I'm keen on modern power system optimization, energy-efficient infrastructure for grid stability, and enhancing system resilience. When not engrossed in academia, I find joy in piano melodies and badminton matches.
