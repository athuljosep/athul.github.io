## Education

## Skills


## Projects
- **Simulation and Prototyping of Dual Rotor Induction Motor** A co-axial dual squirrel cage rotor induction motor is discussed with potential application in electric vehicles. A conceptual analysis and mechanical configuration of this motor is presented in this project.
- **Light Sensitive Emergency Lamp** Energy saving is given high priority in this project. This is done by making sure that the emergency turns on only when absolutely required. Automatic adaption to natural light conditions is added using an LDR.
- **Smart Switch** Innovation of conventional switch into reliable touch switch. Any appliance can be controlled by a single touch.
